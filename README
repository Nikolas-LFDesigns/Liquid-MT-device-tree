As start, sync Cyanogen Mod sources like described on
http://wiki.cyanogenmod.com/wiki/Nexus_One:_Compile_CyanogenMod_%28Linux%29
When done, copy whole acer folder to [your CM path(recommended android/system on home)]/device.
PREPARING BUILD:
fire up liquidcm.sh in dev folder, that contains all necessary makefiles for quickstart with that devicetree;
plug in your Metal (make sure that you have latest rom and adb is set up) and fire up extract-files.sh;
then we can continue :)
To build CM, just follow next instruction:
in terminal:
cd [your CM path]
. build/envsetup.sh
lunch cyanogen_a4-user (brunch is broken for us for now..)
make -j[number of cores that you have * 2]

to make a2sd stuff (which automatically builds only with eng key), just type after successful make:
cd external/e2fsprogs
mm

then, when build is ready, just copy system folder from out/target/product/a4 to /dev folder in devicetree.
find (on any cm-based rom for our device) and place META-INF folder and boot.img file to /dev
change updater-script if necessary on respective file on dev folder
fire up prepare_build.sh to make some cleanups on ready build
zip system with META-INF and boot.img file to make flashable unsigned zip
